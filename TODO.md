# Soul Compiler — Roadmap / TODO

Source of truth for design decisions lives in [`docs/`](docs/):
[compiler-pipeline-plan.md](docs/compiler-pipeline-plan.md),
[mir-design.md](docs/mir-design.md),
[crate-system-plan.md](docs/crate-system-plan.md),
[reflection-system.md](docs/reflection-system.md),
[ANCHORED-crate.md](docs/ANCHORED-crate.md).
This file just tracks status and next steps — update it as work lands, don't duplicate design
rationale from those docs here.

## Pipeline

```
lexer → parser → AST → name/typecheck → MIR → LLVM IR (inkwell) → .exe
```

## Milestones

### M1 — first real exe (in progress)

Concrete, non-generic subset: ints, arithmetic, `println`, functions, structs, non-generic traits.
No `Res`/`.pass`/`?T`, no unions, no generics, no borrow checking yet.

- [x] Tokenizer, parser, name resolver (pre-existing, ahead of the rest of the pipeline)
- [x] MIR shapes defined (`soul_mir/mir_model`) — see [mir-design.md](docs/mir-design.md)
- [x] MIR lowering: assignments, primitive checks (`mir_run` / lowering, per recent commits)
- [x] MIR lowering: if/for/break/continue
- [x] MIR lowering: comparisons and logical ops
- [x] MIR lowering: none-returning functions and calls
- [x] Bare assert/panic and undefined-fn checks
- [x] MIR display/serialization, fault plumbing
- [x] Struct name resolution: `DeclareStore.struct_names: VecMap<ModuleId, HashMap<SharedStr, NodeId>>`
      (`get_struct_by_name`), populated in `try_insert_struct`, lets a later pass resolve a
      struct-typed `SoulType::Stub`'s bare name back to its `Struct` declaration without re-walking
      scopes — keyed by `ModuleId` first (rather than a flat `HashMap<(SharedStr, ModuleId), _>`) so a
      lookup hashes a bare `&str` instead of allocating an owned `SharedStr`. Turned out narrower than
      first scoped during grill-me ("build a whole declare+resolve system mirroring functions") —
      `soul_name_resolver` already had working struct field-type-checking via
      `lookup_type`/`get_custom_type` (proved by the passing `field_access_type_tests.rs`); the only
      real gap was this one name index, not missing anywhere.
- [x] Struct field reads/writes/construction lowered through the whole pipeline and proven via real
      exes (`09_struct_field_read.soul`, `10_struct_field_write.soul`, per the "prove one vertical
      slice before extending further" decision from grill-me):
  - `mir_parser`: `FunctionLowerer` resolves each function's module once via `declares.get_function`,
    accepts struct-typed params/locals/returns (`require_lowerable`), lowers `Struct{..}` construction
    to `Rvalue::Aggregate(AggregateKind::Struct, ..)` with operands reordered to the struct's
    *declared* field order (not literal order), and lowers `variable.field` reads/writes to a `Place`
    with a `PlaceElem::Field(index)` projection reusing the variable's own storage (no copy) — shared
    via `resolve_field_place`, used from both `lower_operand` (read) and `lower_assignment` (write);
    mutability isn't enforced here (that's the M2 borrow checker's job)
  - `mir_codegen`: `llvm_type` builds an LLVM struct type per resolved `Stub`; `resolve_place` walks
    an arbitrary-length `Field` projection chain via `build_struct_gep` for both loads and stores (no
    codegen changes were needed to support nested chains — it was already general); `Rvalue::Aggregate`
    codegens via `get_undef`+`build_insert_value` per field
  - [x] Nested field chains (`o.inner.x`, both reads and writes): `resolve_field_place` in `mir_parser`
    now recurses when the field-access object is itself a field access, building one `Place` with a
    multi-element `Field` projection rather than a chain of temporaries
  - Not yet supported: struct-typed binary-op operands' signedness (`operand_is_signed` doesn't look
    through a `Field` projection — doesn't matter for a bare field read, would matter for `p.x - 1`
    on a signed field)
- [ ] Finish MIR lowering coverage for M1 language surface (non-generic traits; diverging calls for
      div-by-zero / out-of-bounds per mir-design.md)
  - [ ] Array/slice indexing (separate from struct fields — scoped during the grill-me session):
        slices only for now (not stack/heap arrays), fat-pointer (ptr+len) representation decided
        up front so bounds checking can land later without an ABI break, `&arr`-on-an-array-typed-
        place lowers to something other than plain `Rvalue::Ref` in MIR (bare `Ref` stays
        pointer-only) — no bounds checking yet, see below
  - [ ] Overflow checking on arithmetic ops (`+`/`-`/`*`/...), assert-style like Rust's debug
        overflow checks — not started, not designed yet
- [x] `soul_mir/mir_codegen` — LLVM IR emission via `inkwell` (`features = ["llvm16-0"]`, Windows
      only) implemented for scalar/pointer/struct locals, arithmetic/comparison/logical ops, if/while,
      function calls, `extern "C"` functions (incl. `cstr`/pointer params and correct C-vs-Soul
      integer widths via `PlatformInfo`, see below), string/cstr constants, and process-exit-code
      `main` codegen. Structured fault system (`CodegenErrorKind`) replaces `anyhow`.
  - [ ] `f32`/`f64` unsupported (`UnsupportedPrimitiveType`) — no float codegen yet
- [x] Wire codegen output through to an actual `.exe` — `scripts/run_codegen_tests.py` drives
      `clang.exe` (`C:\llvm-16\bin\clang.exe`) over the emitted `.ll`, then runs the resulting exe
      and checks both exit code (`// expect: N`) and stdout (`// expect_stdout: <substring>`); this
      is currently the real correctness oracle for the pipeline (`soul_tester/soul/src/codegen_tests/`,
      11 passing exe tests). Still manual/script-driven, not integrated into `cargo test`.
- [ ] Establish positive+negative test pairs as typecheck/MIR lowering lands (currently unclear
      whether existing parser/resolver suites cover rejection cases — see "Testing strategy" in
      compiler-pipeline-plan.md)
- [ ] `PlatformInfo` (`soul_utils::compiler_options`) only has one constructor
      (`new_windows_x86_64`, 64-bit pointers / 32-bit C `int`) — no actual cross-platform selection
      logic exists yet, it's just a named default

### M2 — borrow/move checking (not started)

- [ ] Implement borrow checker as a MIR pass over the concrete (M1) subset
- [ ] Verify `Drop`/`MarkMoved`/`SetDropFlag` semantics from mir-design.md are fully emitted by
      lowering before the checker can consume them

### M3 — unions, generics, full traits (not started)

- [ ] Monomorphization (expansion to concrete types before LLVM)
- [ ] Full trait resolution incl. multi-impl-by-output-type-generic case (§7)
- [ ] `Res` / `.pass` / `?T` / match-chains
- [ ] Extend borrow checker to generic MIR with `AutoCopy` bounds
- [ ] `limit N` on `for` loops (blocked on `Res` error shape)
- [ ] `SwitchInt` discriminant handling for union tags (`Rvalue::Discriminant`)

### M4 — everything else (not sequenced)

- [ ] `async`/`await` + structured concurrency runtime
- [ ] Const generics (`Limit<T, RANGE>`)
- [ ] Full reflection (`intrinsic.typeinfo`) — AST/compile-time design exists in
      [reflection-system.md](docs/reflection-system.md), backend (HIR/MIR/LLVM) not started
- [ ] Operator overloading
- [ ] Goul

## Crate system (parallel track)

Tracked in detail in [crate-system-plan.md](docs/crate-system-plan.md) and
[ANCHORED-crate.md](docs/ANCHORED-crate.md). `CrateForest` is wired through parser/name-resolver
and the build is green (143 tests passing as of last update there).

- [x] `CrateId` + `Linkage` in `soul_utils`
- [x] `CrateForest` replacing flat `AstModuleStore` in `AstTree`
- [x] Parser routes modules via `forest`
- [x] Name resolver routes via `forest`
- [x] `ast_run` passes forest through
- [ ] `soul_tester` orchestration: dependency compilation, timestamp-based freshness check,
      `.soulo` rebuild
- [ ] `.soulo` prebuilt artifact: write/read the `SOULO` header + object bitcode format
- [ ] Wire `CrateForest.external` into name resolver for cross-crate name resolution
- [ ] Codegen separation using `ExternalCrateData` (static vs dynamic linkage)
